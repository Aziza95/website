            <h1>De-Construct</h1>

            <p>This is an application that I rarely use but have tried to in the past. 
                I remember every single time I try to use it how much frustration I get
                 by some of the layout and functionality of the app. One of many on this list 
                 of frustrating things is how the app doesn’t seem to have auto-saved functions 
                 which leads the user to constantly through a long(er) user journey than necessary. 
                 One thing that also makes me frustrated is the way that the content is placed that 
                 almost feels congested but at the same time has empty space in some part of the app 
                 which doesn’t really makes sense? This is definitely an interesting app to look at 
                 and de-construct because there seems to be a few elements that can be more functional
                  to help the user in their journey and maybe increase the interest to use the 
                  application because it seems like the app isn’t very used because it is buggy.
                Below are some of the problems that I had found after trying to use the app and also look at reviews.</p>
           
            <ul>
                <li>Not receiving a notification after booking a workout</li>
                <li>Not having a digital version of the card</li>
                <li>Not being able to see which queue number you were on</li>
                <li>Not having setting/filters auto-saved</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

            <h1>Analysis</h1>

            <p> Here are some of the UI-patterns that I have found in the app that I will analyse. Something I that mentioned earlier about the app feeling a bit congested might be due to the fact that the are six UI-patterns can be found in one screen, which is the first landing page of the application. This gives me ideas for the re-construct, maybe if the user wasn’t exposed to all this information it would be easier to digest it.
                
            </p>

            <p>I made wireframes using Adobe XD of eight 
                screen that is needed in the user-journey of 
                booking a workout session, I removed some of the 
                screen as they were the duplicates of each and was 
                left with these eight screen.</p>

            <p>
                These were the main changes in the re-construct in regards to the previous analysis made.
            </p>
       
            <ul>
                <li>De-congesting the screens with less items in one page.</li>
                <li>Having the options to save a "home" gym, auto-saved filters.</li>
                <li>Less items on one page and re-affirming colors - to show the amount of people booked. </li>
                <li>Having the physical card digitally on the app, using NFC technologies is possible.</li>
            </ul>

        <div id="user_testing" class="content_box">
            <h1>User-testing</h1>
           
            <p>
                The user-testing showed that the new design did make sense and looked less confusing as for where to push and understand the layout better.
                However there was complaints of the less developed version of the application in comparison to the original. 
                There was a positive reaction to the fact that there was a digital version of the card, since this was big concern with users of the app the chance of 
                losing ones card. The use of colors did really add to the fact of understanding the amount of people but more detailed was wished for as there was only the workout name
                as of the first iteration. Also another comment was the auto-saved filter choices were a "life-saver" and this was something that the two users that frequently used the app wanted
                to fix because even though they had visited several different gyms, usually they only booked workout sessions in one particular gym. And that you had to always re-select was very frustrating.

            </p>
            <p>
                The user-testing showed me that I had the right intentions of the changes that I was had analysed but there was lack of development of some of these function that limited the 
                satisfaction of the overall app. In the future I would like to look at it closer and make a better, more polished and more interactive prototype.
